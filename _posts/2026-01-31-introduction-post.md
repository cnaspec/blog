This is an introduction post for my blog. 

### What parts were new to me?

Using GitHub in general is still pretty new to me, and so I had never made a fork of a repository before. Here is a list of other things which where new to me:

1. Using Jekyll
2. Using Ruby

### What parts did I struggle with?

I am still struggling to get this different repository to be viewable on https://cnaspec.github.io/blog (deliberately not a link!). If this is submitted on time and viewable at that location then it would appear I worked it out. Otherwise, I am still struggling. [An update: the website appears to be working now, although since I do not know why or how it will still be counted as a struggle.]

### What parts still do not make sense?

Please see above. GitHub in general confuses me sometimes.

This is despite me being able to host the website from the previous [task](https://cnaspec.github.io/csci340lab1/) without any issues.

### What am I looking forward to?

I am looking forward to getting better at this. [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog) is another link.

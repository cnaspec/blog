##### This my reflection for the lab on Jekyll Styling. 

### What parts were new to me?

Navigating through all the Minima default files to identify the classes I needed to implement the CSS styling was new to me.

### What parts did I struggle with?

Once again I was stuggling to get the changes implemented on my Github websitite.

- First, there was an issue with building and configuring the page following the first few commits for this lab; however, this mentioned an internal server error so I do not think this was my fault.
- When it did build, my CSS styling did not implement itself. After a few minutes and several refreshes this fixed itself.

### What parts still do not make sense?

I was unable to change the colours of the text inside the header as I could not find the class names (or id) for them since the format is still somewhat confusing to me.

### What am I looking forward to?

I am still looking forward to getting better at this as I don't think I have improved much.

In reference to the [new page]({{ '/dogs/' | relative_url }}), here is an image of my dog.

For my second image, here is a photo of the [New York Public Library](https://www.nypl.org/connect/tours/schwarzman) that I took while travelling in the USA.

### General

The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of wolves. Also called the domestic dog, it was selectively bred during the Late Pleistocene by hunter-gatherers. Dogs and the modern gray wolf share a common ancestor.

### Personal

I like dogs. I have a dog. He is old and I miss him. He spends most of his day asleep and struggles to get up the stairs sometimes. Despite this, he has no problem jumping up on the sofa.

(He is not supposed to be on the sofa.)
